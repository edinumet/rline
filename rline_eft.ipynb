    "## Background\n",
    "Modelling polutant dispersal from fixed point and area sources by the gaussian plume model is obvious but how do we model vehicle emissions from traffic flowing along a road? We just adapt the gaussian plume model by effectively replicating point sources along the roadway and running individual gaussian plume models at each of these points. This is known as a line source model. In this exercise, we will use a line source model called *RLine* from  the US Environmnental Protection Agency. This model has been well used for many years and is used for all sorts of regulatory purposes in the USA. You can read more about RLine at the US EPA's web site - https://www.cmascenter.org/r-line/. You used the UK's DMRB screening model to look at traffic emissions; RLINE is a step up in complexity and realism.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I want you to get out of RLine is an appreciation for how emissions from the vehicle fleet is influenced by wind speed, atmospheric stability and wind direction and how that dictates local air quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Imports\n",
    "Let's start by importing some libraries to the environment:\n",
    "- *matplotlib inline* for creating inline plots\n",
    "- *pandas* to order and sort data in a convenient Table-like format\n",
    "- *numpy* for numerical routines\n",
    "- *matplotlib* for plotting data\n",
    "- *scipy* for interploation routines\n",
    "- *tqdm* for timing progress bar \n",
    "- *subprocess* so we can run RLine which is written in FORTRAN\n",
    "- *ipywidgets* for interactivity\n",
    "- *src* for python code that just takes up space in the main notebook"

    "As we discussed in the lecture series, we need 3 pieces of information to perform a dispersion modelling exercise: weather conditions, an emissions inventory and a dispersion model. <img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"images/dm.png\" alt=\"dispersion model process\" width=\"450px\"/></p>In this exercise, we'll just assume 4 different atmospheric stabilities and use a dispersion model called RLINE which models emissions from traffic. The emissions inventory we will use is derived from vehicle tests under different traffic scenarios and on different road types. It can get a bit complicated to come up with vehicle emissions that are then fed into the dispersion model. <br/><br/>We use a methodology which has been well-documented. I'll give you a flavour of what is involved but the detail can be a bit overwhelming - quite often users in the UK use an Excel-based system called the 'Emissions Factor Toolkit' (https://laqm.defra.gov.uk/review-and-assessment/tools/emissions-factors-toolkit.html and operates rather like the DMRB screening model you used in the practical exercise) but we've found that this no longer seems to be compatible with macs (at least in GeoSciences - it works on Windows PCs) in particular so I've coded it up into python for this exercise (my python code is imported here but if you want to view it, its in the file you downloaded from GitHub)."

    "### Sources of emission data for vehicles\n",
    "\n",
    "In the EU, testing and reporting of vehicle emissions is reported via a service known as COPERT - the DMRB model you used previously uses data from COPERT as input for its calculations (in DMRB you just don't see this level of detail since its a screening model after all). COPERT produces spreadsheets of emission data for >60  vehicle types in Europe and these sheets are organised by vehicle sector (eg passenger cars, articulated lorries, buses etc) and emisisons are given in terms of a polynomial fit to measured emissions tests as a function of speed. Equation 5 below is such an equation. For this model, I've taken one of the COPERT spreadsheets that refers to 2020 emissions and coded the emissions as a function of vehicle type and vehicle speed. This creates the emission inventory we then feed into the RLINE model. The link to COPERT if you want to follow any of this for yourself (and its NOT required for this exercise) is https://www.emisia.com/utilities/copert/  <br></br>\n",

    "As far as I can tell, COPERT does some vehicle emission testing itself but testing vehicles for emissions is a regular part of motor manufacturing and maintenance. While some of it has a dodgy past (think dieselgate from VW https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/11906842/Five-questions-about-the-VW-emissions-scandal-that-wont-go-away.html), there are more safeguards in place now. This is quite a nice read from a personal viewpoint by one 'concerned BBC journalist': https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/how_toxic_is_your_car_exhaust\n",

    "We're going to find all the terms in Equation 1 above to derive the emission factor $E_i$ for our default road system (the simple two intersecting roadways I mentioned earlier).  \n",
    "We'll find the total emissions factor $E F_i$ as a function of all the vehicle types in the COPERT database for PM and NOx using Equation 5.  \n",
    "Next we'll estimate how busy our road system is (you'll enter a number for $AADT$ and time of day (to take trffic congestion into account).  \n",
    "We then feed $E_i$ into RLINE and RLINE then calculates the ground-level concentration of PM and NOx at many different receptor sites.  That's all there is to it!  You can then do sensitivity analysis by changing eg the number of vehicles ($AADT$) on the road o the types of vehicle in the fleet mix (eg what would happen if petrol/diesel cars were largely abandined in favour of electric vehicles?)."
